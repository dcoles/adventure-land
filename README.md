# Adventure Land

My code for [Adventure Land](https://adventure.land/).


## Development

Development is done primarily using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

It is recommended to use the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
extention so you can load code directly from the VSCode.

## Loader

A simple remote code loader is provided in [loader.js](src/loader.js).

This can be used to load code for characters from a remote location.

> Untrusted code may hijack your account, use it to mine crypto currency,
> steal personal data, cause your cat to run away and other nasty things.

## Guide

I have written a small programming guide for Adventure Land that attempts to cover some of the common questions that may come up while writing code for the game.
