# Adventure Land

My code for [Adventure Land](https://adventure.land/).

> 💡 **Note**
>
> This code was developed entirely for my own fun and personal learning experience.
> There are bugs and I'm likely to break things at any point in time.
> Use at your own risk!


## Development

Development is done primarily using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

It is recommended to use the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
extention to allow loading code directly from the editor.

## Remote-Code Loader

A simple remote code loader is provided in [docs/examples/simple_loader.js](docs/examples/simple_loader.js).

Paste the contents of this file into the game's built-in CODE editor (`-` key) to load code from a remote script instead of placing it in-game.

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT — Only use with URLs you control and trust**

> Untrusted code may hijack your account, use it to mine crypto currency,
> steal personal data, cause your cat to run away and other nasty things.

## Guide

I have written a small programming guide for Adventure Land that attempts to cover some of the common questions that may come up while writing code for the game.
